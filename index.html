                        <p>He was known as Orion Pax before and his job was being an Energon Miners <br>
                            His dream job was to be an archiver for the planet cybertron and help  <br>find the location of the matrix <br>
                            He successfully found where the primes had died <br>and reawakend one which gave him his cog to survive <br>
                            He usually is optimistic and tasks alot of risks which earned him the named Optimus Prime</p>

                        He has flame throwers that can also act as a boost when in truck mode. <br>
                        Can form two energy axes on both of his hands and throw them and still keep it. <br>
                        Strong enough to fend off three powerful opponents by himself.</td>

                        Until he learned the truth about Sentinel he was a good person. <br>
                         Until he found out what Sentinel really was <br> he was enraged and killed him to take his cog and create a faction called the Decepticons</td>
                    <td><p>He can transform into a tank <br>
                        Shoot energy balls that are enough to rip a hole through an ordinary transformer <br>
                        A bigger gun on his right hand after taking sentinels cog which is much more powerful <br>
                         than his old but wasnt shown its potential</p></td>

                        He wasnt supposed to have emotion in this movie due to lore but <br>
                        It was also still a good idea to let him keep it because of just one scene where he got scared by Elita One</td>
                    <td>Hes just a jet. <br>
                        More like an airborn tank and is really strong
